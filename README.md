## Cloudflare Pages Setup
Use GitHub repo connection and configure:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Node version: `22` (from `.nvmrc`)

Recommended env vars:
- `NODE_VERSION=22`
- `SITE_URL=https://your-domain.example`
- `PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/your-id`

Important:
- Do not use `npx wrangler deploy` for this Pages setup.
- For direct CLI Pages deploy, use:
  - `npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=reeja-nurse-portfolio`

## Content Source
All portfolio content is centralized in:

- `src/content/profile.ts`

This includes:
- identity/contact details
- summary and goals
- practice areas
- work experience timeline
- credentials/training
- education
- document-evidence summaries
- skills/languages/references

## Single-Page Sections
The homepage includes:
- `#overview`
- `#experience`
- `#credentials`
- `#skills`
- `#contact`

Navigation uses these anchor links for fast scanning and simple UX.

## Assets
Primary assets in `public/`:
- `resume.pdf` (current uploaded resume)
- `og-image.png`
- `reeja-headshot.jpg` (optional)

## Contact Form (Static-safe)
The contact form is embedded in the homepage and posts to Formspree.

1. Create Formspree form.
2. Set `PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT`.
3. `_gotcha` honeypot field is already included.

If env var is missing, a setup warning appears and a placeholder endpoint is used.

## Motion and Accessibility
- Progressive enhancement: content remains readable with JS off.
- Reduced motion respected via system preference + user toggle.
- Lenis and heavy effects are disabled in reduced-motion mode.

## SEO and Security
- SEO meta/OG/Twitter handled in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`
- `robots.txt` in `public/robots.txt`
- sitemap generated by `@astrojs/sitemap`
- security headers in `public/_headers`
