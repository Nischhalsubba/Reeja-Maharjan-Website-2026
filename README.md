- Set production site URL in Cloudflare Pages:
  - `SITE_URL=https://reejamaharjan.com.np`
- `public/robots.txt` must point to:
  - `https://reejamaharjan.com.np/sitemap-index.xml`

- SEO helper utilities live in:
  - `src/lib/seo/schema.ts`
  - `src/lib/seo/meta.ts`
  - `src/lib/seo/keywords.ts`

- `PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/your-id`
- Optional: `NODE_VERSION=22`

## Indexing Verification Checklist
1. Confirm the custom domain serves the Astro HTML site (not a Worker "Hello world" response)

## Manual Off-Site SEO Tasks (White-Hat)

- Add legitimate professional directory/citation links (hospital/healthcare/nursing relevant only)
- Seek quality backlinks from alumni, associations, or conference pages where appropriate
- Avoid keyword stuffing, fake location claims, and low-quality backlink services
